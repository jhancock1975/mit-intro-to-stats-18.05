\section{Problem 3 - 8 Nucleotide Sequences With Pairs}
Suppose a sequence of 8 nucleotides contains 2 each of A, C, G, T.
How many such sequences are there?

Consider the sequence $AACCGGTT$.  There are $8!$ permutations of the sequence.  
However, some permutations will be identical because we have two instances
of each letter in a permutation.

For example $AACCGGTT$ has one $T$ in the seventh position, and one $T$
in the eigth position.  There is a permutation of $AACCGGTT$ where we
move the $T$ in the eighth position to the seventh position $T$, and
we move the $T$ in the seventh position to the eighth position.  The
resulting sequence $AACCGGTT$ is identical to $AACCGGTT$.

For each sequence, we have $2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 16$
identical sequences where we interchange the same letters.

Therefore the number of sequences is $8!/16=2520$
