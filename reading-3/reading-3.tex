\section{Think What is $P\left(S_{2} \mid S_{1}^{\complement}\right)$}

$S_{1}$ = 'first card is a spade'
$S_{2}$ = 'second card is a spade'

Therefore $S_{2}^{\complement}$  = 'second card is not a spade'

We will calculate

\begin{equation}
  P\left(S_{2} \mid S_{1}^{\complement}\right)
\end{equation}

That is, we will calculate the probability that the first card is a
spade given that the second card is not a spade.

We will apply the same method Orloff and Bloom use in \cite{reading3}, 
section 3, "Multiplication Rule."

If the first card is a spade then of the 51 cards remaining, 
$3 \times 13 = 39$ cards are not spades.

Therefore 
\begin{equation} \label{s1S2Condish}
  P\left(S_{2} \mid S_{2}^{\complement}\right) = \frac{39}{51}
\end{equation}

We use the multiplication rule from \cite{reading3} 
to compute the same probability.

We apply the multiplcation rule letting $A=S_{1}$ and $B=S_{2}^{\complement}$

\begin{equation} \label{multRule}
  P\left(S_{1} \cap S_{2}^{\complement}\right) =
  P\left(S_{1} \mid S_{2}^{\complement}\right) \cdot 
  P\left(S_{2}^{\complement}\right)
\end{equation}

$P\left( S_{1} \right) = \frac{13}{52}$  This is because $13$ of the 
$52$ cards are spades.

$ P\left( S_{2}^{\complement} \right) = \frac{39}{52}$ because $39$ 
cards are not spades, and we are dividing by $52$ because any of the 
$39$ out of $52$ cards are equallly likely in all possible sequences 
of two cards.


$P \left( S_{1} \cap S_{2}^{\complement} \right)
 = \frac{13}{52} \frac{39}{51}$
Because there are $13$ out of $52$ spades to draw for the first card,
and $39$ out of $51$ cards that are not spades to draw for the second
card.

We computed $P\left(S_{1} \mid S_{2}^{\complement} \right)$ in 
equation \ref{s1S2Condish}.  Now we will solve equation \ref{multRule} for 
$P\left(S_{1} \mid S_{2}^{\complement} \right)$:

\begin{equation} \label{multRule}
  P\left(S_{1} \mid S_{2}^{\complement}\right) = 
  \frac
  {
    P\left(S_{1} \cap S_{2}^{\complement}\right)
  }
  {
    P\left(S_{2}^{\complement}\right)
  } =
  \frac 
  { 
    \left( \frac{13}{52} \frac{39}{51} \right) 
  }
  {
    \frac{39}{52}
  } =
  \frac{13}{52} \frac{52}{39} \frac{39}{51} =
  \frac{13}{51}
\end{equation}

This is the same result we found in equation \ref{s1S2Condish}.
