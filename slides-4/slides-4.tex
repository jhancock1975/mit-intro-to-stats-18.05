\section{Conditional Probability of Unknown Die}

The first question Orloff and Bloom give in \cite{slides4} is:
\begin{displayquote}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The Randomizer holds the 6-sided die in one fist and the 8-sided
  die in the other.

  \item The Roller selects one of the Randomizerâ€™s fists and covertly 
   takes the die.

  \item The Roller rolls the die in secret and reports the result to the
  table.
\end{enumerate}

Given the reported number, what is the probability that the 6-sided die
was chosen? 
\end{displayquote}

Note: we needed to see the solution in \cite{slides4Ans} in order to
write the answer to this question.

We have two cases.

The first case is the Roller reports a 7 or an 8. Then the 
probability that the 6-sided die was chosen is 0.

The second case is the Roller reports a number with a value from
1 to six.

We draw a probability tree to get started on a solutionn.  We refer
to the section titled, "Shorthand vs. precise trees," in \cite{reading3}
for guidance on drawing the tree below.

$C$ is the event that the Roller selects the cube shaped $6$-sided die.

$O$ is the event that the Roller selects the octohedron shaped $8$-sided
die.

$R1$, $R2$, \ldots, $R6$ are the events that the Roller reports one, 
two, or so on to six.

            }
            edge from parent

        child {

                    {$R_{1}$}] {}
                edge from parent

                    {$R_{2}$}] {}
                edge from parent
                node[above]  {$\frac{1}{8}$}
            }
            child {
                node[end, label=right:
                    {$\ldots$}] {}
                edge from parent
                node[above]  {$\frac{1}{8}$}
            }
            child {
                node[end, label=right:
                    {$R_{6}$}] {}
                edge from parent
                node[above]  {$\frac{1}{8}$}
            }
        edge from parent         
            node[above]  {$\frac{1}{2}$}

\end{center}

Since the probabilities on all edges in the tree connected to $C$ are
$\frac{1}{6}$, and the probabilities on all edges in the tree connected
to $O$ are $\frac{1}{8}$, we can calculate 
$P \left( C \mid R_{1} \right)$, and the result will be the same for
any of the other leaf nodes in the tree above.  This is because the
calculation will involve the same numbers $\frac{1}{2}$, $\frac{1}{6}$,
and $\frac{1}{8}$, and the same operations on these numbers.

Using the tree above, we can calculate $P \left( R_{1} \mid C \right)$.

Now, we use Bayes' theorem in \cite{reading3} to calculate
$P \left( C \mid R_{1} \right)$

\begin{equation} \label{bayesForCube}
P \left( C \mid R_{1} \right) = 
  \frac{ P \left( R_{1} \mid C \right) P \left( C \right)}
    { P \left( R_{1} \right)}
\end{equation}

Now, we apply definitions for values on various parts of probability
trees using the section titled "Shorthand vs. precise trees," in 
\cite{reading3} to obtain values for the numerator and denominator on
the righthand side of \ref{bayesForCube}.

From the probability tree, 
\begin{equation}
P \left( R_{1} \mid C \right) = 
   \frac{1}{6}
\end{equation}

$P \left( C \right) = \frac{1}{2}$.  Note: we are assuming the Roller
uses either die with equal probability.

We apply Bayes rule \cite{reading3} and the Law of Total Probability
\cite{reading3} to compute $P \left( R_{1} \right)$.

\begin{equation}
  P \left( R_{1} \right)
    = P \left( R_{1} \cap C \right) + P \left( R_{1} \cap O \right)
    = P \left( R_{1} \mid C \right) P \left( C \right)
      + P \left( R_{1} \mid O \right) P \left( O \right)
    = \left( \frac{1}{6} \right)  \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)
      + \left( \frac{1}{8} \right)  \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)
\end{equation}

Now we have values for the numerator and denominator of the right
hand side of \ref{bayesForCube}.

\begin{equation}
P \left( C \mid R_{1} \right) = 
  \frac{ 
    \left( \frac{1}{6} \right) \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) 
    }
    {
      \left( \frac{1}{6} \right) \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) + 
        \left( \frac{1}{8} \right) \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) 
    }
\end{equation}
