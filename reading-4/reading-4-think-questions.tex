\section{The Probability Mass Function for $ Z\left( i, j \right) = i + j$}

We write the $pmf$ for the events that we roll two dice and the sum
of the values we roll is a particular value of $a$:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ | c | c | c | c | c |c |c | c | c | c | c |c |}
    \hline
    Value $a$ & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12\\ \hline
    pmf $p \left( a \right)$  & $\frac{1}{36}$ & $\frac{2}{36}$ & 
      $\frac{3}{36}$ & $\frac{4}{36}$ & $\frac{5}{36}$ & 
      $\frac{6}{36}$ & $\frac{5}{36}$ & $\frac{4}{36}$ & 
      $\frac{3}{36}$ & $\frac{2}{36}$ & $\frac{1}{36}$\\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

Orloff and Bloom ask if this looks familiar.  It does not look familiar
to us at this time.

\section{Properties of Cumulative Distribution Functions (cdf's)}

\subsection{cdf's are non-decreasing}

Cdf's are non-decreasing because they are sums of probability mass
function (pmf) values.

Orloff and Bloom define probability mass functions in \cite{reading4}, 
and they state that the value of a probability mass function $p$,
for any input $a$ is always greater than or equal to 0.

If we assume that for some cdf $F$ that $F \left( b \right) <
F \left(a \right), b > a$, that would mean that for some value
$c, a < c \leq b$, $p\left( c \right) < 0$.  Our assumption thus
forces a contradiction of the definition of probability mass functions,
so it must be wrong.  Therefore cdf's are non-decreasing.

\subsection{Cdf's have values between 0 and 1}

Cdf's are sums of pmf's.

The definition of a pmf is the probability of the event
that a random variable, $X$, has some value $a$.

Let $\Omega$ be the sample space of these events.

Consider the two events, $X$ has the value $a_{1}$, 
and $X$ has the value $a_{2}$.  The intersection
of these events is empty, because $X$ is a mapping
to elements of $\R$.

Therefore the sum of the pmf's $P \left( X=a_{1} \right) +
P \left( X=a_{2} right)$ is the probability of the union
of the events $X=a_{1}$ and $X=a_{2}$.

Therefore the sum of all the pmf's for all values of
$a$ is the probability of the union of all events 
that $X$ equals some element of $\R$. The probability
of all events occuring is one,
