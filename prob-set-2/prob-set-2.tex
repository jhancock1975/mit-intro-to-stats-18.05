\section{`Boy or girl' paradox}

In order to write this solution, we rely on the answer to this problem
in \cite{probSet2Ans}, and the treatment of the 'Boy or girl,' paradox
in \cite{boyGirlWiki}.

For these questions on the `Boy or girl paradox we deal with events
$B$, ``the child is a boy,'' and $G$, ``the child is a girl.''

We assume $B$, and $G$ have the same properties as the $B$ and $G$
events Orloff and Bloom analize in example 9 of \cite{reading4}.
These properties are that $B$, and $G$ are independent, and they have
probability $\frac{1}{2}$.

We use these properties to define 4 more events, $BB$, $BG$, $GB$,
and $GG$.  These events are: ``the younger child is a boy, and the older
child is a boy,'' ``the younger child is a boy, and the older child is a
girl,'' ``the younger child is a girl, and the older child is a boy,''
``the younger child is a girl, and the older child is a girl,'' 
respectively.  We use the properties of $B$, and $G$, of example 9 to
compute that the probabilities of $BB$, $BG$, $GB$, $GG$, 
$P\left( BB \right)$, $P\left( BG \right)$, $P\left( GB \right)$, 
$P\left( GG \right)$, are all equal to $\frac{1}{4}$.

\subsection{Probability of girls}
The question Orloff and bloom quote is, ``Mr. Jones has two children. The
older child is a girl. What is the probability that both children are
girls?''

We can restate the question above as,  ``Given event $BG$
or event $GG$, what is the probability $GG$?'' 

We use the definition of conditional probability. We also use the law of
total probability to comupte $P \left( GG \cup BG \right)$.

Therefore we write the equation:

\begin{equation}
P \left( GG \mid GG \cup BG \right) \\
 = \frac{ P \left( GG \cap \left( GG \cup BG \right) \right)}
  {P \left( GG \cup BG \right)}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\frac{ P \left( GG \cap \left( GG \cup BG \right) \right)}
  {P \left( GG \cup BG \right)}
 = \frac{ P \left( GG \right) }
  {P \left( GG \cup BG \right)}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
 \frac{ P \left( GG \right) }
  {P \left( GG \cup BG \right)}
= \frac { \frac{1}{4} }
{ \frac{1}{2} }
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\frac { \frac{1}{4} }
{ \frac{1}{2} }
= \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \left( \frac{2}{1} \right)
=\frac{1}{2}
\end{equation}

Therefore if Mr. Jones' older child is a girl, there is a 
probabiility of $\frac{1}{2}$ that the younger child is also a girl.


\subsection{Probability of boys}

In this section, Orloff and Bloom quote another question for us to 
answer here.

The question is, ``Mr. Smith has two children. At least one of them is a
boy. What is the probability that both children are boys?''

We use the definitions from the previous section for events, $BB$, $BG$,
$GB$ and $GG$. We use the probabilities we found in the first section
for these events as well.

The  author of this question is giving us that three possible events
have occured: $BB$, $BG$, or $GB$.  Furthermore the question asks
for the conditional probability of $BB$.

We use the definition of conditional probability, and the law of total
probability to compute:

\begin{equation}
P \left( BB \mid BB \cup BG \cup GB \right) 
= \frac{ P \left( BB \cap \left( BB \cup BG \cup GB \right) \right) }
  { P \left( BB \cup BG \cup GB \right) }
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\frac{ P \left( BB \cap \left( BB \cup BG \cup GB \right) \right) }
  { P \left( BB \cup BG \cup GB \right) }
= \frac{ P \left( BB \right)}
  { P \left( BB \cup BG \cup GB \right) }
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
 \frac{ P \left( BB \right)}
  { P \left( BB \cup BG \cup GB \right) }
= \frac{ \frac{ 1}{4} }
  { \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4}}
= \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \left( \frac{4}{3} \right)
= \frac{1}{3}
\end{equation}

If at least one of Mr. Smith's children is a boy, then there is a 
probability of $\frac{1}{3}$ that both children are boys.
