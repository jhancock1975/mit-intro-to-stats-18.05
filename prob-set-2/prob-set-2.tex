\section{Boy or girl paradox}
The first question Orloff and Bloom pose in \cite{probSet2} is
on the probability of two similar situations.

The first situation is one where we are given that a man has
two children, one of which is a girl.

We are asked to calculate the probability that both children
are girls.

We take the act of giving birth as an experiment.

We assign the variable $X$ the value 1 if a girl is
born. We assign the variable $X$ the value 0 if a
boy is born.

For each trial the events $X =1$ and $X = 0$ are
equally likely.  So $X \sim \text{Bernoulli} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)$

We model the birth of a child as a Bernoulli trial
\cite{reading4}
where success is the birth of a girl, and failure
is the birth of a boy.  
We assume it is equally likely that a woman give
birth to boy or a girl.

Hence the event of birth of a child
