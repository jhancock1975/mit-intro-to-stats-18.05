\section{'Boy or girl' paradox}

In order to write this solution, we rely on the answer to this problem
in \cite{probSet2Ans}, and the treatment of the 'Boy or girl,' paradox
in \cite{boyGirlWiki}.

For these questions on the 'Boy or girl paradox we deal with events
$B$, ``the child is a boy,'' and $G$, ``the child is a girl.''

We assume $B$, and $G$ have the same properties as the $B$ and $G$
events Orloff and Bloom analize in example 9 of \cite{reading4}.
These properties are that $B$, and $G$ are independent, and they have
probability $\frac{1}{2}$.

We use these properties to define 4 more events, $BB$, $BG$, $GB$,
and $GG$.  These events are: ``the younger child is a boy, and the older
child is a boy,'' ``the younger child is a boy, and the older child is a
girl,'' ``the younger child is a girl, and the older child is a boy,''
``the younger child is a girl, and the older child is a girl,'' 
respectively.  We use the properties of $B$, and $G$, of example 9 to
compute that the probabilities of $BB$, $BG$, $GB$, $GG$, 
$P\left( BB \right)$, $P\left( BG \right)$, $P\left( GB \right)$, 
$P\left( GG \right)$, are all equal to $\frac{1}{4}$.

\subsection{Probability of girls}
The question Orloff and bloom ask is, ``Mr. Jones has two children. The
older child is a girl. What is the probability that both children are
girls?''

We can restate the question above as,  ``Given event $BG$
or event $GG$, what is the probability $GG$?'' 

Using the definition of conditional probability, 
\begin{equation}
P \left( GG \mid GG \cup BG \right) 
 = frac{ P \left( GG \right) }
  {P left( GG \cup BG \right)
\end{equation}
We use the properties of these events that we discuss in the beginning
of this answer, and the law of total probability to comupte that the
probability that both children 

\subsection{Probability of boys}

In this section, we are given that one or more of the children
are boys. asdf
