\section{`Boy or girl' paradox}

In order to write this solution, we rely on the answer to this problem
in \cite{probSet2Ans}, and the treatment of the 'Boy or girl,' paradox
in \cite{boyGirlWiki}.

For these questions on the `Boy or girl paradox we deal with events
$B$, ``the child is a boy,'' and $G$, ``the child is a girl.''

We assume $B$, and $G$ have the same properties as the $B$ and $G$
events Orloff and Bloom analize in example 9 of \cite{reading4}.
These properties are that $B$, and $G$ are independent, and they have
probability $\frac{1}{2}$.

We use these properties to define 4 more events, $BB$, $BG$, $GB$,
and $GG$.  These events are: ``the younger child is a boy, and the older
child is a boy,'' ``the younger child is a boy, and the older child is a
girl,'' ``the younger child is a girl, and the older child is a boy,''
``the younger child is a girl, and the older child is a girl,'' 
respectively.  We use the properties of $B$, and $G$, of example 9 to
compute that the probabilities of $BB$, $BG$, $GB$, $GG$, 
$P\left( BB \right)$, $P\left( BG \right)$, $P\left( GB \right)$, 
$P\left( GG \right)$, are all equal to $\frac{1}{4}$.

\subsection{Probability of girls}
The question Orloff and bloom quote is, ``Mr. Jones has two children. The
older child is a girl. What is the probability that both children are
girls?''

We can restate the question above as,  ``Given event $BG$
or event $GG$, what is the probability $GG$?'' 

We use the definition of conditional probability. We also use the law of
total probability to comupte $P \left( GG \cup BG \right)$.

Therefore we write the equation:

\begin{equation}
P \left( GG \mid GG \cup BG \right) \\
 = \frac{ P \left( GG \cap \left( GG \cup BG \right) \right)}
  {P \left( GG \cup BG \right)}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\frac{ P \left( GG \cap \left( GG \cup BG \right) \right)}
  {P \left( GG \cup BG \right)}
 = \frac{ P \left( GG \right) }
  {P \left( GG \cup BG \right)}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
 \frac{ P \left( GG \right) }
  {P \left( GG \cup BG \right)}
= \frac { \frac{1}{4} }
{ \frac{1}{2} }
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\frac { \frac{1}{4} }
{ \frac{1}{2} }
= \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \left( \frac{2}{1} \right)
=\frac{1}{2}
\end{equation}

Therefore if Mr. Jones' older child is a girl, there is a 
probabiility of $\frac{1}{2}$ that the younger child is also a girl.


\subsection{Probability of boys}

In this section, Orloff and Bloom quote another question for us to 
answer here.

The question is, ``Mr. Smith has two children. At least one of them is a
boy. What is the probability that both children are boys?''

We use the definitions from the previous section for events, $BB$, $BG$,
$GB$ and $GG$. We use the probabilities we found in the first section
for these events as well.

The  author of this question is giving us that three possible events
have occured: $BB$, $BG$, or $GB$.  Furthermore the question asks
for the conditional probability of $BB$.

We use the definition of conditional probability, and the law of total
probability to compute:

\begin{equation}
P \left( BB \mid BB \cup BG \cup GB \right) 
= \frac{ P \left( BB \cap \left( BB \cup BG \cup GB \right) \right) }
  { P \left( BB \cup BG \cup GB \right) }
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\frac{ P \left( BB \cap \left( BB \cup BG \cup GB \right) \right) }
  { P \left( BB \cup BG \cup GB \right) }
= \frac{ P \left( BB \right)}
  { P \left( BB \cup BG \cup GB \right) }
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
 \frac{ P \left( BB \right)}
  { P \left( BB \cup BG \cup GB \right) }
= \frac{ \frac{ 1}{4} }
  { \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4}}
= \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \left( \frac{4}{3} \right)
= \frac{1}{3}
\end{equation}

If at least one of Mr. Smith's children is a boy, then there is a 
probability of $\frac{1}{3}$ that both children are boys.

\section{The blue taxi}

In order to solve this problem we will write a confusion matrix
\cite{confusionMatrix}.  This is the term we found for the kind of 
table Orloff and Bloom write in \cite{reading3} that organizes false
positive rates, false negative rates, etc. Into a table.

We define the following sets:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $D+$, ``The car is blue.''
  \item $D-$, ``The car is green.''
  \item $T+$, ``The witness reports seing a blue car.''
  \item $T-$, ``The witness reports seing a green car.''
\end{itemize}

Orloff and Bloom give us the following probabilities:

\begin{itemize}
  \item $P \left( D+ \right) = 0.01$
  \item $P \left( D- \right) = 0.99$
  \item $P \left( T+ \mid D+ \right) = 0.99$
  \item $P \left( T+ \mid D- \right) = 0.02$
\end{itemize}

In order to make our case, we need to know 
$P \left( D+ \mid T+ \right)$. That is the probability that, given a 
blue car, the witness saw a blue car.  

This table summarizes the information we know.  Note the small 
ratio of blue taxis to all taxis: $\frac{1}{100}$.

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ | c | c | c |  }
    \hline
         & Green & Blue     \\ \hline
    Sees Blue & $P\left(T+ \mid D- \right) = 0.02$ & $P \left( T+ \mid D+ \right)=0.99$   \\ \hline
    Total & $P \left( D- \right) = 0.99$ &  $P \left( D+ \right) = 0.01$   \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

We apply Bayes' theorem \cite{reading3} to $P \left(T+ \mid D+ \right)$
in order to compute $P \left( D+ \mid T+ \right)$.

\begin{equation} \label{blueCarBayes}
P \left( D+ \mid T+ \right)
  = \frac{ P \left( T+ \mid D+ \right) P \left( D+ \right) }
    { P \left( T+ \right) }
\end{equation}

We use the Law of total probability to rewrite the denominator of the
fraction on the righthand side of \ref{blueCarBayes}

\begin{equation}
\frac{ P \left( T+ \mid D+ \right) P \left( D+ \right) }
    { P \left( T+ \right) }
  = 
\frac{ P \left( T+ \mid D+ \right) P \left( D+ \right) }
    { P \left( T+ \cap D+ \right) + P \left( T+ \cap D- \right) }
\end{equation}

We now use the definition of conditional probabilty to rewrite the
probabilities in the denomenator of the equation in the right hand side
of the equation above:

\begin{equation}
\frac{ P \left( T+ \mid D+ \right) P \left( D+ \right) }
    { P \left( T+ \right) }
  = 
\frac{ P \left( T+ \mid D+ \right) P \left( D+ \right) }
    { P \left( T+ \mid D+ \right) P \left( D+ \right) 
      + P \left( T+ \mid D- \right) P \left(D- \right)}
\end{equation}

The terms of the righthand side of the equation above are all in our
table, so we now have a way to compute $P \left( D+ \mid T+ \right)$:

\begin{equation}
\frac{ P \left( T+ \mid D+ \right) P \left( D+ \right) }
    { P \left( T+ \mid D+ \right) P \left( D+ \right) 
      + P \left( T+ \mid D- \right) P \left(D- \right)}
  = \frac{ 0.99 \times 0.01 }
  { 0.99 \times 0.01 + 0.02 \times 0.99 }
\end{equation}

Now we simplify the right hand side of the euqation above to arrive at
a value for $P \left( D+ \mid T+ \right)$.
\begin{equation}
 \frac{ 0.99 \times 0.01 }
  {  \left(0.01 + 0.02 \right) \times 0.99 }
  = \frac{ 0.99 \times 0.01 }
  {  0.03 \times 0.99 }
  = \frac{1}{3}
\end{equation}

Therefore there is a $\frac{1}{3}$ that given a blue taxi, the witness
sees a blue taxi.  This is a less than $50\%$ chance that the witness
actually saw a blue taxi. Hence we have a reasonable doubt that the 
witness saw a blue taxi.

\section{Trees of cards}

In this section we answer Orloff and Bloom's question in \cite{probSet2}
about the expected value of a random variable.

The random variable is the value of the sum of cards we draw from a 
hat.  

We refer to a card of rank one as an ace, and a card of rank two as
a two.

There are four aces, and four two's in the hat.

Rules govern the way we draw the cards from the hat.  The rules are: 
\begin{itemize}
\item If we draw an ace first, then we draw one more card. 
\item If we draw a two first, then we draw two more cards.
\end{itemize}

We assign one to the value of the ace, and two to the value of the two.

We assign the random variable $X$ the value of the sum of the values
of the cards we draw.
