\section{Exact Formula For $P\left(B\right)}
An element of $\omega \in \Omega$ is a sequence of birthdays.  
A birthday is an integer from $1$ through $365$. 
All birthdays are equally likely, and two or more people can be born on the same day,
so any $\omega$ of length $n$ is a sample with replacement from the set
$\left\{ 1, 2, 3, ..., 365 \right\}$ The number of samples of length $k$
when we sample with replacement from a set of size $n$ is $n^k$. 
Therefore the total number of $\omega \in \Omega$ for a given $n$ is $365^{n}$.

Therefore $365^{n}$ is the denomenator we use when we are dividing our count
of events by the total number of events to calculate a probability.

It will be easier to calculate the probability $\bar{p\}$ that for an $\omega$ containing $n$ birthdays, 
none of the birthdays are the same.  Then the probability $p$ that some two birthdays in $\omega$ are the same 
will be $1-\hat{p}$.
