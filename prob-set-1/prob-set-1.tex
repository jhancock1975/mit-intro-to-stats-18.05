\section{Problem 1: Poker Hands}
\subsection{Two-Pair}
We calculate the probability of the poker dealer dealing us a 
hand that is a two-pair hand. First we count the number of two-pair
hands, then we divide the number of two-pair hands by the total
number of hands to calculate the probability of the dealer dealing us
a two pair hand.

The definition of a two-pair hand is, "Two cards have one rank, 
two cards have another rank, and the remaining card has a third rank.
e.g.$\left\{ 2\heartsuit, 2\spadesuit, 2\clubsuit, 5
\clubsuit, K\diamondsuit \right\}$." \cite{probSet1}

We take a combinations approach similar to the approach Orloff and
Bloom take to calculate the probability of a one-pair hand in
\cite{classSlides2}.

First we choose the ranks of the pairs.  There are $13$ ranks, so
there are $\binom{13}{2}$ ways to choose the ranks of the pairs.

Next we choose the suits for the cards in the pairs.  There are
$\binom{4}{2}$ ways to select the suits for the cards in the first
pair, and $\binom{4}{2}$ ways to select the suits for the cards in
the second pair.

To complete the hand we select one card.  We have $11$ ranks to choose
from for the fifth card, and $\binom{4}{1}$ ways to select its suit.

We apply the rule of product to count the number of two-pair hands:

\begin{equation}
\binom{13}{2} \binom{4}{2} \binom{4}{2} 
\binom{11}{1} \binom{4}{1} = 78 \times 6 \times 6 \times 11 \times 4 = 
123552
\end{equation}

The number of all poker hands is the number of ways to select $5$ items
from a set of $52$ items.  Therefore the number of all poker hands is
$\binom{52}{5} = 2598960$.

Therefore the probability of a two-pair hand is $\frac{123552}{2598960}
\approx 0.048$.

\subsection{Three-of-a-Kind}
Orloff and Bloom give the definition of a three-of-a-kind hand as,
"Three cards have one rank and the remaining two cards
have two other ranks. e.g. $\{2\heartsuit, 2\spadesuit, 2\clubsuit,
5\clubsuit, K\diamondsuit\}$." \cite{probSet1}

We use the same approach as above.

First we select the rank for the three cards that have the same rank.

There are $13$ ranks, so there are $\binom{13}{1}$ ways to select this
rank.

Next we select the suits for the three cards that have the same rank.
There are 4 suits, and we choose one for each card, so there are
$\binom{4}{3}$ ways to select the suits for the 3 cards.

We have $\binom{12}{2}$ ways to select the ranks for the fourth 
and fifth cards, and $\binom{4}{1}^{2}$ ways to select their suits.

Now we apply the rule of product to count the number of 
three-of-a-kind hands:

\begin{equation}
\binom{13}{1} \binom{4}{3} \binom{12}{2} \binom{4}{1}^{2} =
13 \times 4 \times 66 \times 16 = 54912
\end{equation}

Therefore the probability of a three-of-a-kind hand is 
$\frac{54912}{2598960} \approx 0.021$.

\section{Problem 2: Non-transitive Dice}
\subsection{Probabilities and Ordering Dice}
\subsubsection{White vs. Green and Green vs. Red}
We follow the method Orloff and Bloom use to calculate the probability
that red beats white\cite{classSlides2}.

We write probability tables for white dice and green dice:

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ | c | c | c |}
    \hline
    Green Die & & \\ \hline
    outcomes & 1 & 4 \\ \hline
    probability & $\frac{1}{6}$ & $\frac{5}{6}$  \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ | c | c | c |}
    \hline
    White Die & & \\ \hline
    outcomes & 2 & 5 \\ \hline
    probability & $\frac{1}{2}$ & $\frac{1}{2}$  \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

Next we write the probability table for the product sample space of
white and green dice:

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ | c | c | c | c| }
    \hline
     & & Green Die & \\ \hline
    & & 1 & 4 \\ \hline
    White Die & 2 & $\frac{1}{12}$ & $\frac{5}{12}$\\ \hline
     & 5 & $\frac{1}{12}$ & $\frac{5}{12}$ \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

The pairs in the table above where the outcome for white is greater
than the number for green correspond to outcomes in the product
sample space where white wins.  These are: $\{ white=2, green=1\}$,
$\{white=5, green=1\}$, and $\{white=5, green=4\}$.

We then add the corresponding probabilities for these outcomes where
white wins to to calculate the probability that white wins:
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{12} + \frac{1}{12} + \frac{5}{12} = \frac{7}{12} \approx 0.583
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Ordering the Dice}
When we write one color beats another color, for example, "...red
beats white..." we mean the outcome where the number we roll for the
first color die is greater than the number we roll for the second
color die.
From \cite{classSlides2}, we know that there is a $\frac{7}{12}$
probability that red beats white.
From the previous subsection, we know that there is a $\frac{7}{12}$
probability that white beats green.

Now we are required calculate the probability that green beats red.

We do the probability calculation as we do in the previous section.

We write the probability table for the red die:

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ | c | c | c |}
    \hline
    Red Die & & \\ \hline
    outcomes & 3 & 6 \\ \hline
    probability & $\frac{5}{6}$ & $\frac{1}{6}$  \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

For our convenience, we repeat the probability table for the green
die:

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ | c | c | c |}
    \hline
    Green Die & & \\ \hline
    outcomes & 1 & 4 \\ \hline
    probability & $\frac{1}{6}$ & $\frac{5}{6}$  \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

Now we write the probability table for the product sample space of 
red and green dice:

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ | c | c | c | c| }
    \hline
     & & Green Die & \\ \hline
    & & 1 & 4 \\ \hline
    Red Die & 3 & $\frac{5}{36}$ & $\frac{25}{36}$\\ \hline
     & 6 & $\frac{1}{36}$ & $\frac{5}{36}$ \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

The outcomes where red beats green are $\{red=3,green=1\}$, 
$\{red=6, green=1\}$, and $\{red=6, green=4\}$.  We sum 
the corresponding probabilities in the above table to compute
the probability that green beats red:

\begin{equation}
\frac{5}{36} + \frac{1}{36} + \frac{5}{36} = \frac{11}{36}
\approx 0.306
\end{equation}

Now we are armed with enough information to answer the question 
of whether or not we can order the dice from best to worst.

From \cite{classSlides2} we know the probability that red beats
white is $\frac{7}{12}$.  We have calculated here the probability that
white beats green is $\frac{7}{12}$, and the probability that red
beats green is $1-\frac{11}{36}=\frac{25}{36}$.  Therefore it is more
likely that red will beat white, white will beat green, and green will
beat red.  Therefore we cannot arrange the dice in order from best to
worst.

Note: we had to look at \cite{probSet1Solutions} to get the answer for
the ordering question.

\subsection{Rolling Two Dice}

The authors of the problem set \cite{probSet1} ask us, "Suppose you roll
two white dice against two red dice. What is the probability that the
sum of the white dice is greater than the sum of the red dice?"

The authors also suggest we watch the video \cite{youTubeDice}. The 
material in the video is crucial to our ability to write this
answer.  The text of \cite{probSet1} also hints that we should
follow the methods in \cite{probSet1}, and use a probability tree
to answer this question.

Note: we used the example in \cite{probTreeHowTo} to render the
probability trees below.

We start with rolling the two white dice.  The nodes linked to the root
of the probability tree represent the possible combinations
we can roll using two white dice.  The edges linking the root node
of the probability tree to the nodes representing the possible
combinations we can roll for the two white dice are labeled with the
probability of rolling a combination of dice.  

We use the multiplication rule for independent events to compute the 
probability of rolling a combination of white dice. The white die has
three faces with a value of $5$, and three faces with a value of $2$,
so we have a probability of $\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$ for rolling 
either a $2$ or a $5$.  Therefore there is a probability of
$\frac{1}{2}\times\frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}$ of rolling two $5$'s or
two $2$'s.

We use the multiplication and addition rules for independent events
to compute the probability of rolling one $5$ and one $2$: there are
two ways we can roll one $5$ and one $2$, so the probability
of rolling one $5$ and one $2$ is:

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2}
=\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{2}
\end{equation}

We use similar reasoning for completing the probability tree.

We cross out nodes in the tree where the path through the tree
to the leaf node represents an experiment where the sum of what
we roll for the white dice is not greater than the sum of what we
roll for the red dice.

% Set the overall layout of the tree
\tikzstyle{level 1}=[level distance=3.5cm, sibling distance=3.5cm]
\tikzstyle{level 2}=[level distance=3.5cm, sibling distance=2cm]

% Define styles for bags and leafs
\tikzstyle{bag} = [text width=4em, text centered]
\tikzstyle{end} = [circle, minimum width=3pt,fill, inner sep=0pt]

% The sloped option gives rotated edge labels. Personally
% I find sloped labels a bit difficult to read. Remove the sloped options
% to get horizontal labels.

                edge from parent
                node[above]  {$\frac{1}{36}$}
            }
        edge from parent         
            node[above]  {$\frac{1}{4}$}
    };
\end{tikzpicture}
We use the rule of product for independent probabilities to calculate
the probability of each outcome where the sum of the value we roll 
for the white dice is greater than the sum of the value we roll for
the red dice.

We multiply the probabilities on the edges of the probability tree above
where the edge is on a path to a leaf node where the label on
the leaf node is not crossed out.

Path 1: With the white dice we roll two $5$'s, and with the red dice
we roll one $3$ and one $6$.  The probability for this outcome is
$\frac{1}{4} \times \frac{10}{36} = \frac{10}{144} \approx 0.069$.

Path 2: We roll two $5$'s with the white dice, and we roll two $3$'s
with the red dice.  The probability of this outcome is:
$\frac{1}{4} \times \frac{25}{36} = \frac{25}{144} \approx 0.174$

Path 3: we roll one $5$ and one $2$ with the white dice,
and with the red dice, we two $3$'s.  The probability of this outcome 
is: $\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{25}{36} = \frac{25}{72} \approx 0.347$

We use the addition rule for independent outcomes to compute the
probability for the outcome of path 1, or path 2, or path 3.

The sum of the probabilities is approximately 
$0.069 + 0.347 + 0.174 = 0.59$

\section{Birthdays: counting and simulation}
Note: we did not find this problem to be trivial, so we performed a
Google search on the term, "birthday problem," to get some clues
on how to proceed with a solution.  We find the web pages
\cite{birthProbWiki}, and \cite{betterExpBirth} helpful in writing
this solution.


\subsection{Proability function for $\Omega$}
For this problem, the elements $\omega$ of $\Omega$ are sequences of $n$
birthdays, one for each person in the group.  

An example $\omega$ when $n=5$ is $\left( 1, 2, 2, 1, 1) \right)$.

All birthdays are equally likely.

Therefore we can write any sequence of birthdays by sampling the
integers ${1,2,3...365}$ with replacement.
