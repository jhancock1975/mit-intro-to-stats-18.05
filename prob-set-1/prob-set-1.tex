\section{Problem 1: Poker Hands}
\subsection{Two-Pair}
We calculate the probability of the poker dealer dealing us a 
hand that is a two-pair hand. First we count the number of two-pair
hands, then we divide the number of two-pair hands by the total
number of hands to calculate the probability of the dealer dealing us
a two pair hand.

The definition of a two-pair hand is, "Two cards have one rank, 
two cards have another rank, and the remaining card has a third rank.
e.g.$\left\{ 2\heartsuit, 2\spadesuit, 2\clubsuit, 5
\clubsuit, K\diamondsuit \right\}$." \cite{probSet1}

We take a combinations approach similar to the approach Orloff and
Bloom take to calculate the probability of a one-pair hand in
\cite{classSlides2}.

First we choose the ranks of the pairs.  There are $13$ ranks, so
there are $\binom{13}{2}$ ways to choose the ranks of the pairs.

Next we choose the suits for the cards in the pairs.  There are
$\binom{4}{2}$ ways to select the suits for the cards in the first
pair, and $\binom{4}{2}$ ways to select the suits for the cards in
the second pair.

To complete the hand we select one card.  We have $11$ ranks to choose
from for the fifth card, and $\binom{4}{1}$ ways to select its suit.

We apply the rule of product to count the number of two-pair hands:

\begin{equation}
\binom{13}{2} \binom{4}{2} \binom{4}{2} 
\binom{11}{1} \binom{4}{1} = 78 \times 6 \times 6 \times 11 \times 4 = 
123552
\end{equation}

The number of all poker hands is the number of ways to select $5$ items
from a set of $52$ items.  Therefore the number of all poker hands is
$\binom{52}{5} = 2598960$.

Therefore the probability of a two-pair hand is $\frac{123552}{2598960}
\approx 0.048$.

\subsection{Three-of-a-Kind}
Orloff and Bloom give the definition of a three-of-a-kind hand as,
"Three cards have one rank and the remaining two cards
have two other ranks. e.g. $\{2\heartsuit, 2\spadesuit, 2\clubsuit,
5\clubsuit, K\diamondsuit\}$." \cite{probSet1}

We use the same approach as above.

First we select the rank for the three cards that have the same rank.

There are $13$ ranks, so there are $\binom{13}{1}$ ways to select this
rank.

Next we select the suits for the three cards that have the same rank.
There are 4 suits, and we choose one for each card, so there are
$\binom{4}{3}$ ways to select the suits for the 3 cards.

We have $\binom{12}{2}$ ways to select the ranks for the fourth 
and fifth cards, and $\binom{4}{1}^{2}$ ways to select their suits.

Now we apply the rule of product to count the number of 
three-of-a-kind hands:

\begin{equation}
\binom{13}{1} \binom{4}{3} \binom{12}{2} \binom{4}{1}^{2} =
13 \times 4 \times 66 \times 16 = 54912
\end{equation}

Therefore the probability of a three-of-a-kind hand is 
$\frac{54912}{2598960} \approx 0.021$.

\section{Problem 2: Non-transitive Dice}
\subsection{Probability White Beats Green}
We follow the method Orloff and Bloom use to calculate the probability
that red beats white\cite{classSlides2}.

We write probability tables for white dice and green dice:

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ | c | c | c |}
    \hline
    Green Die & & \\ \hline
    outcomes & 1 & 4 \\ \hline
    probability & $\frac{1}{6}$ & $\frac{5}{6}$  \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ | c | c | c |}
    \hline
    White Die & & \\ \hline
    outcomes & 2 & 5 \\ \hline
    probability & $\frac{1}{2}$ & $\frac{1}{2}$  \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

Next we write the probability table for the product sample space of
white and green dice:

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ | c | c | c | c| }
    \hline
     & & Green Die & \\ \hline
    & & 1 & 4 \\ \hline
    White Die & 2 & $\frac{1}{12}$ & $\frac{5}{12}$\\ \hline
     & 5 & $\frac{1}{12}$ & $\frac{5}{12}$ \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

The pairs in the table above where the outcome for white is greater
than the number for green correspond to outcomes in the product
sample space where white wins.  These are: $\{ white=2, green=1\}$,
$\{white=5, green=1\}$, and $\{white=5, green=4\}$.

We then add the corresponding probabilities for these outcomes where
white wins to to calcuate the probability that white wins:
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{12} + \frac{1}{12} + \frac{5}{12} = \frac{7}{12} \approx 0.583
\end{equation}
