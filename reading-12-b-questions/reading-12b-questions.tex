We are answering questions in the material from MIT OpenCourseWare
course 18.05, Introduction to Probability and Statistics.

We use documentation in to write the \LaTeX code for
this document.

In this document we are answering questions Orloff and Bloom ask in
\cite{reading12bqu}.

\section{Odds of one event}
For this question, Orloff and Bloom give us an event $A$, where 
$P\left(A \right) = 0.4$.  They ask us what the odds are for the event.

The odds $O\left(A\right) = \frac{P\left(A\right)}{P\left(A^{C}\right)}$.

Therefore $O\left(A \right) = \frac{0.4}{0.6} = \frac{4}{6}$.

\section{Odds of three events}
In this section we answer questions that Orloff and Bloom have for three
events, $A, B, ,$ and $C$ that have probabilities $0.3, 0.6,$ and $0.1$,
respectively.

\subsection{Odds of event $A$}

The odds of event $A$, $O\left(A\right)$ are something we calculate under
the assumption that $A^{C} = B \cup C$.  We make this assumption because
the calculation we do matches what Orloff and Bloom want when we make the
assumption. Therefore:

\begin{equation}
O\left(A\right) = \frac{P\left(A\right)}{P\left(B\right) + P \left(C\right)}
\end{equation}

We substitute the numbers Orloff and Bloom give us into the right hand side
of the equation above:

\begin{equation}
O\left(A\right) = \frac{0.3}{0.6+ 0.1}
\end{equation}

Therefore, $O\left(A\right) \approx 0.429$.

\subsection{Odds of $B$ versus $C$}

We use the definition of the odds of one event versus another event that Orloff 
and Bloom give in \cite{reading12b}.

Then the odds of event $B$ versus $C$ are 
$\frac{P\left(B\right)}{P\left(C\right)}=\frac{0.6}{0.1}$. 

Therefore $\frac{P\left(B\right)}{P\left(C\right)}=6$.
