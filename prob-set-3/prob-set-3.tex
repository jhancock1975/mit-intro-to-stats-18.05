\section{References and License}
We are answering questions in the material from MIT OpenCourseWare
course 18.05, Introduction to Probability and Statistics.

In this document we are answering questions Orloff and Bloom ask in
\cite{probSet3}.

\section{Independence}

In this section we answer a problem in \cite{probSet2} that involves rolling
two six sided dice.

\subsection{Pairwise and mutual independence}
We define two events, $A$, and $B$ to be pairwise independent if
$P \left( A \cap B \right) = P \left( A \right) P \left(B \right)$.

For this problem Orloff and Bloom give us the definition of mutual independence
for three events, $A$, $B$, and $C$.  $A$, $B$, and $C$ are mutally independent
if
\begin{equation}
	P \left( A \cap B \cap C\right)
	= P \left(A \right) P \left(B \right) P \left( C \right)
\end{equation}

In this section, Orloff and Bloom give the following definitions for events
$A$, $B$, and $C$:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $A$ is the event that we roll an odd number with the first die.
	\item $B$ is the event that we roll an odd number with the second die.
	\item $C$ is the event that the sum of the numbers we roll is odd.
\end{itemize}

$A$, $B$, and $C$ are not mutually independent.  Whatever the
$A$, $B$, and $C$ probabilities of $A$, $B$, and $C$ are individually, the
probability of  $P \left( A \cap B \cap C\right)$ is $0$ since the sum of two
odd numbers is always an even number.

\subsection{Venn diagram}

Orloff and Bloom give the following Venn diagram:

\def\firstcircle{(0,0) circle (1.5cm)}
\def\secondcircle{(45:2cm) circle (1.5cm)}
\def\thirdcircle{(0:2cm) circle (1.5cm)}

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\begin{scope}[shift={(3cm,-5cm)}, fill opacity=0.3]
        \fill[red] \firstcircle;
        \fill[green] \secondcircle;
        \fill[blue] \thirdcircle;
        \draw \firstcircle node[below, opacity=1] {$0.225$} node[xshift=1cm, yshift=0.5cm, opacity=1] {$0.125$} node[left, yshift=0.5cm, opacity=1] {$A$};
        \draw \secondcircle node [above, opacity=1] {$0.225$}
				%intersection of a and b below:
					node[below, xshift=0.5cm, opacity=1]{$0.1$}
				%intersection of b and c below:
					node[below, xshift=-1.14cm, opacity=1]{$0.05$}
					node[left, yshift=0.5cm, opacity=1] {$B$};
        \draw \thirdcircle node [below, opacity=1] {$0.175$}
					node[left, xshift=-0.75cm, yshift=-0.5cm, opacity=1]{0.1}
					node[left, yshift=0.5cm, opacity=1] {$C$};
					node[xshift=]
    \end{scope}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

And ask us whether or not the events in the Venn diagram above are mutually
independent.

These events are not mutually independent because
\begin{equation}
	P \left(A \right) P \left(B \right) P \left( C \right) =
		0.225 \times 0.225 \times 0.175 = 0.008859375.
\end{equation}

However, in the Venn diagram above, Orloff and Bloom give us that
$P \left( A \cap B \cap C\right) = 0.125$

Therefore the events are not mutually independent.

\subsection{How many kids}
For this question we use the same assumptions about the probability of the
gender that a child is born with that Orloff and Bloom use in example 9 of
\cite{reading4a}.

For this question, Orloff and Bloom give us that a familiy has children of
both sexes.  The probability of a mother giving birth to a male is $0.5$, and
the probability of the independent event of a mother giving birth to a female
is $0.5$.

Also for this question, Orloff and Bloom give us that there is at most
one female child in the family.  The probability of this event is also $0.5$.
