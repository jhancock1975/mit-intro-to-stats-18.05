We are answering questions in the material from MIT OpenCourseWare
course 18.05, Introduction to Probability and Statistics.

We are answering the questions that Orloff and Bloom ask in
\cite{reading5aQuestions}.

\section{Variance of a random variable}
In this section we answer the question that Orloff and Bloom ask regarding
the variance of a discrete random variable.

The following table describes a discrete random variable $X$:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ | c | c | c | c|}
    \hline
    $X$ & $1$ & $2$ & $4$ \\ \hline
		PMF $p \left(x \right)$ & $0.2$ & $0.3$ & $0.5$ \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

We will use the formula from \cite{reading5a} for variance:
\begin{equation}\label{varFormula}
	Var \left( X \right) = E \left( X^{2} \right) - E \left( X\right)^{2}
\end{equation}

First we compute $E \left( X \right)$:
\begin{equation}
  E \left( X \right) = 1 \times 0.2 + 2 \times 0.3 + 4 \times 0.5
    = 0.2 + 0.6 + 2 = 2.8
\end{equation}

Now we compute $E \left( X^{2} \right)$:
\begin{equation}
  E \left( X^{2} \right)
    = 1 \times 0.2 + 4 \times 0.3 + 16 \times 0.5
    = 0.2 + 1.2 + 8
    = 9.4
\end{equation}

Now we apply the formula for variance in equation \ref{varFormula}:
\begin{equation}
Var \left(X \right)
  = 9.4 - \left( 2.8 \right)^{2}
  = 9.4 - 7.84
  = 1.56
\end{equation}

\section{Apply properties of variance}

The second question in \cite{reading5aQuestions} is in several parts; Orloff
and Bloom ask us several questions where we apply the properties of the variance
of discrete random variables to answer.

Orloff and Bloom write that $X$ is a random variable with mean 2 and variance
3.

\subsection{Variance of constant multiple}
Orloff and Bloom ask is for us to compute $Var \left( 3X \right)$

In \cite{reading5a} Orloff and Bloom show for constants $a$, and $b$
\begin{equation}\label{varMultPlus}
  Var \left( aX + b\right) = a^{2}Var(X)
\end{equation}

Therefore $Var \left( 3X \right) = 9 \times 3 = 27$

\subsection{Variance of multiple plus constant}

Orloff and Bloom pose a second question that is a variation on the previous
question. They ask us to compute $Var \left( 3X + 8 \right)$

However, by \ref{varMultPlus} the answer to this question is no different than
the answer to the previous question.  Therefore, $Var \left( 3X + 8 \right) = 27$

\subsection{Expected value of square}

Orloff and Bloom ask us to compute $E \left( X^{2} \right)$.

We apply equation \ref{varFormula} to compute the answer to this question.

\begin{equation}
	Var \left( X \right) = E \left( X^{2} \right) - E \left( X\right)^{2}
\end{equation}

This implies

\begin{equation}
	3 = E \left( X^{2} \right) - 4
\end{equation}

We rewrite the equation above placing unknown terms on the left hand side,
and known terms on the right hand side of the equation below:

\begin{equation}
	E \left( X^{2} \right) =  4 + 3 = 1
\end{equation}

\section{Further Questions on Same Random Variable}
For this problem, Orloff and Bloom continue to ask us questions on the same
random variable they define in the previous question.

\subsection{Variance of square}
In this section, Orloff and Bloom ask us if we can compute a value for
$Var \left( X^{2} \right)$.

We cannot compute this value because the only information we have about $X$ is
the value of its mean and variance. Terms in the sum to compute
$Var \left( X \right)$,  $ \left( x_{i} - \mu \right)^{2}$
might be very different from terms in the sum to compute
$Var \left( X^{2} \right)$, $\left( x_{i}^{2} - \mu \right)^{2}$.

\subsection{Negative Values}
Orloff and Bloom ask if $X$ can take negative values.

The short answer is yes.  However we can construct an example with the aid
of R.

\begin{lstlisting}
> x = c(-2, -1, 0, 1, 2)
> mean(x)
[1] 0
> var(x)
[1] 2.5
> var(sqrt(3/2.5) * x)
[1] 3
> var(sqrt(3/2.5) * x + 2)
[1] 3
> mean(sqrt(3/2.5) * x + 2)
[1] 2
> sqrt(3/2.5) * x + 2
[1] -0.1908902  0.9045549  2.0000000  3.0954451  4.1908902
>
\end{lstlisting}

To get started, we create a list, and assume the contents of the list are
the product $p \left(x_{i} \right) x_{i}$, of a probability mass function and
the value of a random variable.  Values of a probability mass function are
always positive, so the negative values in the list must be negative values
of the random variable.

We use the properties of variance that Orloff and Bloom show in \cite{reading5a}
to transform the list into a list that has a variance of 3 and a mean of 2.

Hence; the list satisfies the parameters of $X$ given in problem 2 of
\cite{reading5aQuestions}; it has a mean of 2 and a variance of 3.

On the last line of the listing we print out the values of the transformed list.

One sees that the first value in the list is negative.  Since we assumed that
the elements of the list are products of a random variable's value and its
probability mass function's value for that value, the random variable's value
must be negative.  Therefore, in the long way of answering this question, $X$
can have negative values.
