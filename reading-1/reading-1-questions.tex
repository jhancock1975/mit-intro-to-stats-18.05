\section{Applying DeMorgan's First Law}
The set of students that are female, or freshman, junior, or senior is
equal to the set of students that are female, and freshman, junior or senior.

\section{Combinations 1}
How many ways to choose $4$ kittens from a litter of 9.

This is equal to $\binom{9}{4} = 126$

\section{Problem 2 - Nucleotides}
How many sequences of 8 nucleotides can be made using any of the 4 
nucleotides A, C, G, T at each place of the sequence?

We have 4 choices for a nucleotide at each of the 8 positions, so
the number of sequences is $4^{8} = 65536$.
